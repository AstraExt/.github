Welcome to **Astra**.
Astra is more than just software; it's a vision to enrich the GNOME environment with user-friendly, efficient, and cutting-edge functionalities. From seamless extensions to powerful utilities, Astra is designed to elevate your GNOME experience to new heights.

## About Astra

Astra is at the beginning of its journey in the world of free and open-source software (FOSS), focusing on enriching the GNOME ecosystem. Currently, we have two projects underway: one recently released and another in development. Our aim is to enhance the GNOME experience with practical and innovative solutions, starting small but thinking big.

## Our Projects

- **[Astra Monitor](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor)**: System monitoring extension for GNOME's top bar.
- **Astra View**: _Under heavy development._

_More projects are in the pipeline, and we welcome contributions!_
